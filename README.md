# Single-Wire CAN for the [mcp_can](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield) library

This is the original Single-Wire CAN library written for the Macchina M2.  It works with [Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield) at commit 4aee975485e85ab74e0d30ce7000aa056128f27d and needs updates to work with the latest version.

**It is recommended you use [macchina/Single-Wire-CAN-mcp2515](https://github.com/macchina/Single-Wire-CAN-mcp2515) instead of this library.**
